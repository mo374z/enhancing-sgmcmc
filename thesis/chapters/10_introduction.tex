\section{Introduction} \label{chap:introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}

\subsection{Problem}

\begin{itemize}
    \item in high dimensional, complex posteriors we are often confronted with ill-conditioned Hessians
    \item this might lead to slow convergence when the sampler is not able to accord to this
    \item we can show this effect on some simple gaussian (mixture) examples
\end{itemize}

Note: the visualizations show the true density in the background, while compute the steps of the MCMC sampler on samples of the log density.


\subsection{Research Objective}

\begin{itemize}
    \item use preconditioning
    \item
\end{itemize}

By investigating this research objective we contribute to the field of MCMC sampling in the following ways:...

Name here what was developed in the end and how it contributes to the field.
