\section{Introduction}\label{chap:introduction}

\subsection{Background}

\begin{itemize}
    \item in high dimensional, complex posteriors we are often confronted with
          ill-conditioned modes
    \item this might lead to slow convergence when the sampler is not able to adapt to
          the local curvature of the posterior
    \item we can show this effect on some simple gaussian (mixture) examples
\end{itemize}

Note: the visualizations show the true density in the background, while compute
the steps of the MCMC sampler on samples of the log density.

\subsection{Research Objective \& Contributions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item preconditioning the MCMC sampler to accord to the local curvature of the
          posterior
    \item investigate whether this leads to better uncertainty quantification and
          convergence properties
    \item investigate whether this leads to better exploration of the posterior (detect
          multi-modality)
\end{itemize}

This contributes to the fields in the way, that overall less samples/shorter
chains are needed to achieve resonably good results.
