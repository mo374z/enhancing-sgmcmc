\chapter{Experiments}\label{chap:experiments}

\section{Experimental Setup}\label{sec:experimental-setup}

\section{Methods}\label{sec:experimental-methods}

% Describe how the particular methods or algorithms that are being used are set up.
% Here you should describe (and possibly justify) the choices you have made about configuration options in your algorithms.

% Also describe the baselines that you are comparing against:
% Are you using your own implementations of various algorithms, or existing packages?

\section{Data}\label{sec:data}

% Describe various relevant aspects to your experiments, and give them their own section if they are warrant a more detailed description.
% E.g.\ if you did experiments on different datasets, they should be described, together with possible justifications for the choice of data, or how the specific choice of datasets could influence or bias the results.

\section{Metrics}\label{sec:metrics}

% Similar subsections could be created about other aspects of the experiments.
% Remember that conducting the experiments itself is only a part of the experiments; how you evaluate the resulting raw data is also important and should be described.
% This includes what kinds of metrics are collected (and what they mean), how they are being treated statistically, what kinds of statistical tests you do etc.
